# devmate_test
Project focused on exploring how TestMate functions in aiding the generation of test code.

DevMate is a test case generation helper tool. However, it does not generate new scenarios based on artificial intelligence. This is the type of tool I am looking for, and therefore, it did not make sense to further explore its capabilities.
